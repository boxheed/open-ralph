# 🤡 Ralph Agent (v1.0.0)
> "I'm helping!" — An autonomous, reliability-first AI coding loop.

Ralph Agent is a platform-agnostic implementation of the **Ralph Wiggum Pattern**. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that simply generate code, Ralph operates in a **Propose → Execute → Verify → Fix** loop. It treats the AI as a junior engineer that is not allowed to commit code until the validation tests pass.



---

## 🛠 Features
- **Deterministic Workflow:** Processes tasks alphabetically from Markdown files.
- **Reliability Loop:** Automatically retries fixes up to 3 times upon test failure.
- **Safety First:** Hard-stop "Circuit Breaker" to prevent token-burn and hallucination loops.
- **Audit Trails:** Every AI "thought" and shell output is appended to the task file.
- **Platform Agnostic:** Works with Gemini CLI, but modular enough to swap with Aider, Claude-Code, or GPT.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **Gemini CLI** (for the default AI engine)
  ```bash
  npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
  ```

### Global Install (via GitHub)
Install the agent directly from the repository to use the ralph command anywhere:

```bash
npm install -g [https://github.com/your-username/ralph-agent](https://github.com/your-username/ralph-agent)
```
### Local Development Setup

```
git clone [https://github.com/boxheed/open-ralph.git](https://github.com/boxheed/open-ralph.git)
cd open-ralph
npm install
npm link
```

## 📖 How to Use

  1. Initialize a Project   
  Run the setup command in your target repository to create the task folders:   
```bash
ralph setup
```

  2. Author a Task   
  Create a .md file in `tasks/todo/`. The filename determines the order of execution (e.g., `01_fix_header.md`).


  Example Task: 
```markdown
---
task_id: "AUTH-001"
validation_cmd: "npm test src/auth.test.js"
affected_files: ["src/auth.js", "src/config.js"]
---

# Objective: Correct JWT Expiration
The token is currently set to expire in `5m`. We need to change this to `1h` (one hour) to match our security policy.

## Success Criteria
1. Locate where `EXPIRES_IN` or similar is defined.
2. Update the value to 1 hour.
3. Run the validation test to confirm the token generated actually has a 1-hour lifespan.
```
  3. Run the agent   
```bash
# Headless mode (Automatic)
ralph

# Interactive mode (Pause for review before validation/commit)
ralph --interactive
```


## ⚙️ Configuration

Ralph supports multiple AI providers (Gemini, Aider, GitHub Copilot, etc.). The default is `gemini`.

### Setting the Provider

You can set the provider globally in `ralph.config.js` or per-task in the front matter.

**`ralph.config.js`**:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  provider: "aider", // Set default to Aider
  providers: {
    aider: {
      // Override default command template
      command: "aider --model gpt-4 --message \"{prompt}\" {files}"
    }
  }
};
```

**Task Front Matter**:
```markdown
---
task_id: "FEAT-123"
provider: "gemini"
...
---
```

### Supported Providers

- **gemini** (Default)
- **aider**
- **github-copilot**
- **forge**
- **nanocoder**
- **cline**
- **opencode**
- **qwen-code**

## 🏗 Modular Architecture

  * `bin/ralph.js`: CLI Entry point and argument parsing.
  * `src/engine/`: The Core Loop logic and state management.
  * `src/services/`: Pluggable connectors for Git and AI (Gemini).

## 🛡 Safety & Circuit Breakers
  * Git Check: Ralph will refuse to run if the repository has uncommitted changes.
  * Max Retries: If a validation command fails 3 times, Ralph moves the task to /failed and stops to prevent infinite loops.
  * Interactive Gate: Use `--interactive` to inspect code changes in your IDE before the agent executes the validation shell commands.

  ## 🤝 Contributing
  * Create a task in /tasks/todo for your feature.
  * Run ralph to let the agent build its own improvements.
